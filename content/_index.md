I'm a RHCSA and CompTIA certified engineer with a background in Linux administration and software engineering. I'm fascinated with cybersecurity's constantly evolving arms race between hackers and defenders and how to build a secure IT infrastructure to provide a safe environment for people and organizations to create a better world. I'm interested in roles that deploy, manage, and secure computing infrastructure.
