I design, deploy, and secure computing infrastructure that helps people create a better world.

I'm a developer with proven experience in [Red Hat Linux](https://rhtapps.redhat.com/verify?certId=240-145-797), [AWS](https://cp.certmetrics.com/amazon/en/public/verify/credential/1351875bbfdd4c8ca378eb07d96644b0), and [Kubernetes](https://www.credly.com/badges/55d18804-07f2-43a2-9b98-ddf3e19053c5/public_url). I also try to apply what I've learned to real-world scenario with my [projects](https://patimapoochai.github.io/projects/).

In my spare time, I share my knowledge with the tech community by [publishing guides for new tools](https://patimapoochai.github.io/posts/nixos-sudoers/) or [writing about my experiments with alternative open-source solutions](https://patimapoochai.github.io/projects/self-hosted-iam/).
